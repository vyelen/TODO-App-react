<h1>TODO App (React.js)</h1>
<p>My TODO App that i remake in React.js</p>
<p>you can copy this app by just make new react app and download src folder in this repo and replace your src folder in your project, I can't upload the whole project because there is so many items in react project (Github limit: 100 items/upload)</p>
<p>The app have some issue, like looks weird on other device (except laptop)</p>
